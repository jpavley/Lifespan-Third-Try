## Open

- If the user leaves the name field blank on the profile tab then the empty string is used as the user's name in the analysis text and tombstone.
- On the profile tab fields are not saved until the user explicitly exits a field thus field text can be different from the saved text in the profile object when the user jumps to different tab.
- It looks like there is a space before the users name when is the first substring in an analysis text paragraph. Maybe an artifact of the large bold style. Also paragraph 2nd from last (that starts with pronoun).
