/// Model of a partial dial that displays the difference between chronological age (what the calendar says) and biological age (what your doctor says).
///
/// LifeFactor is the ratio of modified ALE to unmodified ALE (ale/mALE). LifeFactor is used to calculate biological age based on mALE.
/// - If a user's mALE is higher than his ale then his LifeFactor is lower and his biological age is less than his chronological age.
/// - If a users mALE is lower than his ale than his LifeFactor is higher and his biological age is more than his chrological age.
///
/// LifeBonus is a percentage that describes the positive or negative effect of LifeFactor on a user's life span.
/// - If there is no effect (ale == mALE) LifeBonus is 0%
/// - If there is a positivie effect LifeBonus is  > 0%
/// - If there is a negative effect LifeBonus is < 0%
/// - A negative LifeBonus is a "LifePenality"
