<h1>Lifespan Third Try</h1>

<p>This project contains an iOS app that implements a <em>life clock</em>. The idea is to map a human life span from birth to estimated death on a 12-hour analog clock. The time the clock is set to represents the subjects current age in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds. By glancing at the life clock now and then, the subject is reminded not to waste valuable time on trival matters.</p>

<p>Lifespan  incorporates <em>longevity factors</em> into the estimation of a subject's life. These factors include activity level, stress level, risk behavior level, and quality of genetics. The subject self-scores these factors on a scale from 1 to 10. Some small attempt has been made by the author to apply the most recent scientific thinking to these factors in terms of their impact on longevity. But, honestly, there is little hard-data and the author of this app assumes that in the years to come research will continue to break the current model of longevity and bring new factors into consideration. Therefore, Lifespan is an app for insprirational, entertainment, and educational purposes. Lifespan's job is to enable the subject to focus on their life and how much they left of it, not in anyway predict the length of a subject's life.</p>
