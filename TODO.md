# TODO

## Open

- Update the tab bar icons to reflect design changes.
- Add unit tests back in from ealier version of project.
- Support Dynamic Type (Attributed Text does not support dynamic type).
- The Analysis code is a horrible mess! What is really needed is a single templating and formatting engine that talks marked up text and turns it into Apple's Attributed Text. Yeah, I know, the simple solution is  HTML and web views. Unfortunately for me web views, even local ones, make a few noticable moments to load. I don't want to implement a progress indicator for an app that doesn't hit a server!

## In Progress

## Parked

- Update clock design so it is more modern.
- Add famous lives, large scale events, and celestial events to analysis.
- Rewrite the tips as poetry (rhymed coupets)

## Closed

- Update tombstone when user profile controls are modified.
- Profile View Controller needs to manage and dismiss keyboard when editing of personal data is done.
- Update Lifespan object to take risk and genetics into account.
- Dismiss the keyboard when the user hits the return key, when the user taps outside the keyboard, or when the user scrolls
- Update analysys to take risk and genetics factors into account.
- Add open source license (MIT).
- Complete readme tab and format with CSS
- First Bug: Intermitent disagreement between analysis and tombstone about profile age calculation.
- Change locked fields in user profile tab into labels.
- Convert readme into attributed type.
- Create bugs list.
- Convert analysis text into attributed type.
- Bold the numeric text in the clock key: One hour is **6.92** years
- Need to differententiate between "0" lifefactors (basically not set yet) and low (1-4).
- Implement alerts with tips for factors on Profile tab.
- The tip alert dialog box text is too small and formatted poorly. Create a custom view!
- Update Life "Clock logo" type to read "Life Span".
- It's too hard to set the birth day, month, and year with sliders. Use regular fields.
- It's too much of a pain in the but enter in custom pronouns. Use a way to set all three at once without typing.
- Make the tip view even more polished: rounded corners, no border, add graphics, better typography
- create tip for gender pronouns.
- The analysis doesn't changes between low, medium, and high that impact longetivity. A so-called "low" level of activity can positively impact longetivity.
- Replace the Readme view with an car dashboard like speedometer, odometer, and fuel guage. This view will display biological vs chronological age.
